                <h2>Hometown</h2>
                <p>I live in the city of Louisville, Kentucky. Louisville is a fairly large city and is home to a large 
                    number of pool players. Many local tournaments are hosted here with great payouts and the skill here 
                    tends to be higher than other cities.</p>

                <p>I had played pool for fun with family and friends, but have never thought that it would be something 
                    that I would be passionate about. I didn't start shooting pool until I was about 24. I joined a 
                    league with my dad and my uncle, playing at a local bar every Thursday afternoon.</p>

                <p>It definitely started off very frustrating, with me losing most of my games, but I quickly became 
                addicted and wanted to improve. I learned from players around me and practiced every chance 
                that I could. Over the following years, I would improve and win more and more of my games.</p>

                <p>I have now been playing pool for a little over nine years. I still shoot in my league every 
                thursday afternoon, though my team has changed a few times. I also shoot in several tournaments 
                throughout the year, with my largest payout being a little over a thousand dollars.</p>

                <p>If you want to learn more about pool or if you're considering joining a league, you can visit the 
                    <a href="https://poolplayers.com/" target="_blank">APA website</a> for more information!</p>
