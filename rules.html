                <p>This is the most popular game played when someone wants to play a game of pool using all 
                    15 of the numbered balls. Rules are subject to change depending on who you are playing 
                    with or what league you are in, but the general rules are all the same.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rack the balls with the 8 ball in the middle.</li>
                        <li>One player is stripes and the other is solids, determined by who makes a ball first.</li>
                        <li>Pocket all of your balls, call your pocket on the 8 ball and make it to win.</li>
