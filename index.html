                <h2>All About the Basics</h2>
                <p>Whether you are just wanting to improve so you can beat your friends or wanting to step up 
                    and play competitively, it all starts with the basics. Without the fundamentals, you have no 
                    foundation to build on. Visit the <a href="basics.html">Basics</a> page to get started on your journey.</p>

                <h2>Have Fun</h2>
                <p>Pool can be frustrating, inconsistent and takes a considerable amount of skill to reach higher 
                    levels. You may also notice the amount of luck (or lack there of) involved when playing. No 
                    matter the outcome of your game, at the end of the day, have fun. Enjoy the game and always 
                    push to be better. Frustration never helps. So, if you find yourself wanting to snap that pool 
                    stick over your leg, take a break and remember that it's just a game!</p>
