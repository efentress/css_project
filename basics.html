            <h2>Creating a Foundation</h2>
            <p>If you are reading this page, it is safe to assume that you want to improve your game. Below are 
                the basic steps that you need to take to develop a good foundation:</p>

            <div class="sections">
                <section class="stance">
                    <h3>Stance</h3>
                    <img src="../css_project/img/stance.jpg" alt="Shooting Stance">
                    <p>Though it may not seem like much, your stance has an effect on your aim. You should always 
                        stand with your feet apart and one foot forward. Stay down for the entirety of your shot 
                        before you move and you should see more balls find their way to the pockets.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="stroke">
                    <h3>Stroke</h3>
                    <img src="../css_project/img/stroke.jpg" alt="Pool Stroke">
                    <p>Your stroke plays a huge role in your accuracy. If your storke isn't straight when you take 
                        your shot, then the ball will not roll straight. An easy exercise for this is to take a bottle 
                        with an opening not much larger than the diameter of your cue tip and practice stroking in and 
                        out of the bottle openeing. This can even be done without a pool table!</p>    
                </section>

                <section class="aim">
                    <h3>Aim</h3>
                    <img src="../css_project/img/aim.jpg" alt="Aiming the Ball">
                    <p>Knowing where to aim is vital. If you aren't aiming correctly, you will miss most of the 
                        shots that you take. One way to help improve your aim is to utilize something called a 
                        "ghost ball". Look at the ball you are wanting to make and the pocket you are aiming at. 
                        Find the point on the ball where you have to hit it to make it go to that pocket. Now, 
                        imagine where that cue ball has to hit. That is your "ghost ball".</p>
                </section>

                <section class="attitude">
                    <h3>Attitude</h3>
                    <img src="../css_project/img/attitude.jpg" alt="People Having Fun">
                    <p>As with anything else you do in life, your attitude will always have an effect on what you 
                        do. Stay positive, clear minded and open to coachings and suggestions. If you approach the 
                        table frustrated, you are most likely not going to take your time or think a shot through. 
                        The best thing you can do is have fun and your skills will develop over time.</p>
                </section>
            </div> 

            <p>Once you have perfected those four basics, you are on your way to truly improving your game. 
                Then you can begin working on safeties, cue ball control, english and so much more. This is 
                one game where you will never stop learning and no two people see the table the same or shoot 
                the same. </p>
